Compilation
-----------

We use maven to handle our dependencies.

* Install [Maven 3](http://maven.apache.org/download.html)
* Check out and install [Spigot-API](http://github.com/SpigotMC/Spigot)
    * *Note*: this is not needed as the repository we use has Spigot-API too, but you might have a newer one (with your own changes :D)
* Check out this repo and: `mvn clean package`
# NoobSpigot-Server
